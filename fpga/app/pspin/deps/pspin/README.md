# PsPIN: A RISC-V in-network accelerator for flexible high-performance low-power packet processing

<div align="center"><img src="docs/overview.svg" alt="PsPIN architecture overview" /></div>


PsPIN [1] is an implementation of the sPIN programming model [2] based on PULP [3]. This repository includes the RTL code implementing PsPIN, the runtime software, and a set of examples to get started. We provide a toolchain that allows to define, build, and test new handlers through cycle-accurate simulations. 


**Simulation Workflow summary:** The RTL code is verilated into C++ modules that are compiled together with the functional models into two libraries: `libpspin.so` and `libpspin_debug.so`. To write your own handler, you need to define the handler code and a simulation driver. The handler code must be compiled with [RISC-V GCC](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-riscv-gcc/tree/fe3ea0638f9e9bf563da8f2251d139727258f5aa). The simulation driver interfaces to `libpspin.so` for (1) initializing the simulation; (2) defining the content of L2 handler memory; (3) defining the handlers to offload; (4) defining and injecting packets to process; (5) handle events generated by the execution of the handlers (e.g., packets being sent or writes/reads to/from host memory). By linking against `libpspin_debug.so` you make the simulation a `waves.vcd` that can be explored with any value-change-dump editor (e.g., GTKWave http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).

**Repo organization:** The repositority has the following structure:

 - `hw/`: Hardware components and simulation logic.
   - `hw/deps/`: (RTL) Dependencies from the PULP platform (https://github.com/pulp-platform). Some of them have been adapted to fit in the PsPIN design. **License:** SolderPad 0.51.
   - `hw/src/`: (RTL) PsPIN components. **License:** SolderPad 0.51.
   - `hw/verilator_model/`: (functional) Components implementing the NIC model shown by the above figure. **License:** Apache 2.0.
 - `sw/`: Software components. **License:** Apache 2.0.
   - `sw/pulp-sdk/`: Dependencies from the PULP SDK adapted to fit the PsPIN design. 
   - `sw/rules/`: Makefile rules used to ease simulutions setups and runs. 
   - `sw/runtime/`: HPUs runtime code and support functions for the handlers. 
   - `sw/script/`: utilities for extracting data from the simulation output. 
 - `examples/`: Examples of sPIN handlers. **License:** Apache 2.0.
    - `examples/*/driver/`. Simulation driver.
    - `examples/*/handlers/`. Handlers code.
