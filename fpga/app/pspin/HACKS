List of hacks incorporated while developing.

- 24-bit address space for s_axil_app_ctrl_*; low 16 bit is used to reconstruct the pspin host side address
- hw/deps/pulp_cluster/rtl/pulp_cluster.sv: removed tryx_ctrl and joined s_core_periph_bus and s_core_periph_tryx
- apb_bus.sv compile order: set compile order to manual in Vivado; see https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/69320?language=en_US
